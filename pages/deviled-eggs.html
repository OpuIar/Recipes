    <h3>Ingredients</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>1 12 eggs</li>
        <li>Â½ cup mayonnaise</li>
        <li>4 slices bacon</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons finely shredded Cheddar cheese</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon mustard</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Instructions</h3>

    <ol>
        <li>Place eggs in a saucepan, and cover with cold water. Bring 
            water to a boil and immediately remove from heat. Cover, and 
            let eggs stand in hot water for 10 to 12 minutes. Remove from 
            hot water, and cool. To cool more quickly, rinse eggs under 
            cold running water.</li>

        <li>Meanwhile, place bacon in a large, deep skillet. Cook over 
            medium-high heat until evenly brown. Alternatively, wrap 
            bacon in paper towels and cook in the microwave for about 1 
            minute per slice. Crumble and set aside.</li>

        <li>Peel the hard-cooked eggs, and cut in half lengthwise. 
            Remove yolks to a small bowl. Mash egg yolks with mayonnaise, 
            crumbled bacon and cheese. Stir in mustard. Fill egg white 
            halves with the yolk mixture and refrigerate until serving.</li>
    </ol>
